# Analysis-and-Visualization-of-PISA-2012-Dataset
## Dataset

The PISA 2012 dataset consists of 636 columns with 485490 entries. From which 26 columns have been chosen for this analysis. The columns or variables I chose for the analysis were country, age, maths score, reading score, science score, cultural background of father, mother, self, learning time of maths, reading and science etc.


## Summary of Findings

First, I plotted the histogram of scores obtained in each individual subject. I found that a vast majority of students scored between 300 to 600 points in each subject, with a small number of students scored low between 100 to 300 points as well as scored high between 600 to 800.

After analysing this result, I was curious to know about which countries performed exceptionally well. I set the score above 800 for high achieving students and extracted their data along with their country of origin. I figured out that students mostly from Asian countries like China and Singapore performed exceptionally well with Singapore as the leader in excellency in all the three subjects.

In bivariate exploration, I analysed how individual countries performed in each subject. From this analysis I found that Asian countries performed best in all the three subjects with China-Shanghai, Singapore and Hong Kong-China leading the test as the top scored countries. It can also be seen that the mean score obtained in all the three subjects by students of China-Shanghai deviated significantly from the rest of the list.

I explored the relationship between the scored obtained in each individual subject in multivariate analysis. A strong correlation between the score in all the three subjects have been found. 

I was also interested to know about the learning time distribution of each subject and how the learning time effected the score obtained. This analysis depicted that scores obtained were not always dependent on the time the students spent learning. There can be several other factors which had effected the score.

Another factor which I considered in this analysis is the effect of parents cultural background on the score. Parents cultural backgrounds were classified as same and different depending upon the whether the cultural background of both parents matched or not. It was found that parents cultural background had slight effect on the score obtained in all the three subjects. Students who come from a different background had shown a little bit higher performance in the test.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I first depicted the distribution of scores in each subject. 
Next, I portrayed the countries who showed exceptional results (i.e. number of students who obtained >800) in each subject.
I also depicted the effect of learning time and parents cultural background on the score.
Lastly, I showed the correlation between the score of all the three subjects of assessment in PISA 2012.
